## Overview
Furlastic Duo is a cooperative 3D puzzle platformer where a cat and a dog solve puzzles using unique abilities while linked by a spectral entity. The game supports local and online multiplayer, with a single-player mode that lets you toggle between characters.

## What I built (Lead Programmer)
- Built the tether mechanic from scratch in Unity (C#), using custom physics logic to compute real-time tension and forces between characters.
- Designed the system to be designer-friendly by exposing tunable parameters so level designers could iterate without touching code.
- Implemented a JSON-based save system for persistent game state.
- Helped ship the project through multiple milestone builds (prototype → demo → alpha → final).

## Key features
- Dual character gameplay with a “swap vision” mechanic for puzzle-solving.
- Levels spanning multiple themes (e.g., cyberpunk cities and solarpunk farms) with unique interactions.
- “George the Ghost” mechanic where the linking entity affects the environment and puzzles.
- Local + online multiplayer support.

## Tools & tech
Unity, C#, custom physics, vector math, OOD, JSON, Git

## Highlights
- Capstone project developed in a studio-style team environment.
- Publicly showcased and playtested at a live event.
