## What I built
- Analyzed subsets of a 2PB dataset to identify global risk trends and support stability forecasting.
- Developed and tuned a Random Forest model and validated it against historical logs.
- Supported automated anomaly detection and data-driven recommendations.

## Tools & methods
Python, SQL, Random Forest, statistical validation, anomaly detection

## Outcome
A forecasting + anomaly detection workflow designed to support stakeholder-ready insights from extremely large datasets.
